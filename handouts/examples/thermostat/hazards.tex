This list of hazards is not yet complete; we have not identified hazards for \emph{L5: Physical harm to humans or pets}, and we haven't expressed much about \emph{L3: Damage to facilities, property, or the heating equipment itself}.


%It may be tempting to start thinking about the following:

%H6& Thermostat-measured temp differs from actual room temp by >X degrees.&L1-L4\\
%\hline
%H7& Substantial lag between the change in actual temp and the change in measurement.&L1-L4\\
%\hline
%H8& Substantial lag between signaling HEAT ON or HEAT OFF and furnace turning on or off.&L1-L4\\
