[ \section{Identifying Causal Scenarios}]

\newthought{Definition}

Now we ask, ?What could cause an operator or part of the system to take an inappropriate action or fail to take action when needed?? A \textbf{causal scenario} is a description of how and why the \textbf{unsafe control action} could happen.
For each \textbf{unsafe control action}, we will inspect the \textbf{control loop} that action is part of in the \textbf{hierarchical control model}, indentifying how flaws in that control loop could cause that action to occur in that particular inappropriate way.Consider each of the control loop flaws, or \textbf{causal factors}, marked on the control loop diagram, and ask ?How could that factor contribute to this unsafe control action?? 

Once we have a list of causal scenarios, we can check whether our system has mechanisms to address them.

\newthought{Desired Qualities}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Completeness --- When finding causal scenarios for a particular unsafe control action, consider each part of the control loop in which the action occurs.
\item Plausibility --- Could this happen at all?
\item Relevance
\end{compactitem}

\newthought{Strategic Approaches} 

This is an exercise in focused brainstorming; we might not think of everything, but focusing on the system bit by bit may make it easier to come up with potential problems we hadn?t considered earlier.

\begin{compactitem}
\item \textsc{Divide and conquer} --- This work can be split up among several people.\item \textsc{Pace your efforts} --- Track progress, returning later as needed.\item \textsc{Triage and prioritize} --- Prioritize investigating actions needing additional scrutiny, e.g. actions that are new, poorly understood, currently changing, be-lieved to be risky, or involved in close interactions with other systems that need additional scrutiny.
\end{compactitem}

\newthought{Relationship to other concepts}

Each \textbf{unsafe control action} maps to several \textbf{causal scenarios}.
Each \textbf{causal scenario} maps to at least one unsafe control action.

When performing this step, we use the \textbf{hierarchical control model} to identify system parts relevant to the action being inspected.

When we check our list of causal scenarios to see whether our system has mechanisms to address them, we identify new system requirements.
