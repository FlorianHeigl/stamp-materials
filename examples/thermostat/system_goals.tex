Consider a heating system involving a thermostat-controlled furnace (boiler with baseboards).

\textbf{Intent statement:} Warm an apartment to a user-specified temperature by means of a thermostat-controlled furnace in order to provide a comfortable living space and prevent destruction of property due to cold temperatures (e.g. frozen pipes).

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{9cm}|}
\hline
&\textbf{Goals}\\
\hline
G1 & Allow a user to specify a target temperature\\
\hline
G2 & Raise the apartment temperature to the target temperature within a reasonable period of time (specify)\\
\hline
G3 & Maintain an apartment temperature within 2 degrees of the user-specified target\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

We might also choose to include goals about supporting \emph{energy efficiency}.
Use your judgment about what to consider an essential part of the mission.
